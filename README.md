# Trend_Forecasting
## ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Forecasting for Stock Prices and Financial Indicators

This project aims to predict stock prices using different approaches for time series modeling and machine learning. The solution combines statistical models and neural networks, leveraging advanced techniques to generate more accurate and robust forecasts.

## ðŸš€ Technologies and Frameworks Used

* Statistical Models

* GARCH (volatility and financial time series)

* SARIMA (seasonal time series modeling)

* Deep Learning and Machine Learning

* TensorFlow

* PyTorch

* Regression Algorithms


## ðŸ“Š Project Structure

Data Collection â†’ Loading historical stock price and market data.

Feature Engineering â†’ Creating new features (technical indicators, transformations, lags, etc.).

Feature Selection â†’ Selecting the most relevant features for forecasting.

Time Series Model Training â†’ Training classical models (ARIMA, SARIMA, GARCH, etc.).

Feature Forecasting â†’ Forecasting features (e.g., volatility, trend components).

Machine Learning & Deep Learning Training â†’ Training ML/DL models (regression, LSTM, GRU, Transformers) to predict Close Price.

Close Price Forecasting â†’ Generating predictions for future stock prices.

Result Evaluation â†’ Comparing forecasts vs. actual values using error metrics and visualization.

Close Price Transformation â†’ Applying transformations (log, differencing, scaling) for improved model stability.

Retraining ML & DL Models â†’ Re-training models with transformed data to enhance performance.

New forecasting 

Final Forecasting & Evaluation â†’ Producing final close price forecasts and analyzing results against benchmarks.

# ðŸ”® Applications

* Beyond stock price forecasting, this project can be applied to various scenarios involving time series and numerical prediction, such as:

* Revenue and expense forecasting

* Cash flow projection

* Sales and product demand forecasting

* Inventory and supply chain planning

* Energy and natural resource consumption forecasting

* Healthcare forecasting (hospitalizations, epidemiological outbreaks)
